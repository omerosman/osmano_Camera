I originally planned on using face tracker but the plugin would not work on my computer.
Here is what my original idea entailed.
If eyes were closed: Camera goes black
If eyes were open: Camera works fine
If person smiled: Exposure increases
If person frowned: Exposure decreases
If person opens mouth: Exposure resets
